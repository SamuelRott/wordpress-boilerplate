# worpdress/composer/gulp/sass boilerplate

One of the multiple way to locally develop a Wordpress with the advantages of gulp tasks.

## based on
  https://github.com/roots/bedrock for WordPress/composer and inspired by https://github.com/oskarrough/rough for gulp tasks.

  Both are adapted to fit together.
